# IBM Data Science Certification Projects  
This repository contains the projects I completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate programme. These projects demonstrate my ability to apply essential data science skills, including:  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovering patterns, trends, and insights from datasets through detailed analysis and visualisations.  
- **Data Visualisations**: Crafting clear and impactful visualisations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate findings effectively.  
- **Machine Learning**: Building, training, and evaluating models for tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering using Scikit-learn.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **Programming**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git
